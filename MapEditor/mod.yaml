    - Various bug fixes and performance improvements
- version: '1.3.25152.217'

    - Added support for mods to register editable objects, see AMM documentation.
    - Removed Loader support, this will be handled by AMM now.
    - Added switch helpers
    - Additional query tool info
        - Now shows the tile coordinates under the cursor.  
        - Also shows map height mask groupings. The number is the `order` of the mask,  
          these are grouped and processed as a batch. If a group has more than 256 items,  
          it will get truncated to 256, causing terrain to not be updated for the lost masks.
    - A lot more QOL changes and bug fixes.
