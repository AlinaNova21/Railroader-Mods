things that im planing to modify:


bug: when moving segment old chevrons arent destroyed

i think instead of using TrackNodeAwake and TrackSegmentAwake they should be added to game via EditorContext.OpenMixinto
    - so game do not create all those MonoBehaviour instances when theyre not used
    - this should also fix missing lines on newly created segments
    

TrackSegmentDialog ui looks wierd :/
